        For!
        For you left before me
        My!
        My pale morning star
        Now!
        Now you walk in undying light
        And I!
        And I'm still chained in this rimed soil
        And still I can sense you
        Still I can hear your voice
        Still I quiver under your touch
        Celestial shine in your hair
        Empyreal crown upon your brow
        Radiance blurs my deary eyes
